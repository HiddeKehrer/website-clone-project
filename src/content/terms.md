To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will the Wafrow UG entities be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages (including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, or any other intangible loss) arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your inability to access or use, the service or any materials or content on the service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other legal theory, and whether or not any Wafrow UG entity has been informed of the possibility of damage.
2. Except to the fullest extent permitted by law, the aggregate liability of the Wafrow UG entities to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the use of or any inability to use any portion of the service or otherwise under these terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you have paid to Wafrow UG for access to and use of the service in the 12 months prior to the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim and (b) US$100.
3. Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does allocate the risks between the parties under these terms. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these terms. The limitations in this section 16 (limitation of liability) will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

## 17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

1. **Online:** The EU Commission has created a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR platform), which can be accessed via the following link: [http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/) Here complaints or requests can be posted online. In accordance with Section 36 of the German Act on Alternative Dispute Resolution in Consumer Matters (VSBG), we hereby inform you that we are neither willing nor obliged to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.
2. **Governing Law.** The contractual relationship between Wafrow UG and the user will be governed by German law, unless a different jurisdiction is applicable as per Law. Claims arising from consumer protection standards can be asserted by the user in accordance with German law or the law of the EU member state in which she or he resides. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods dated 11 April 1980 shall not apply.
3. **Jurisdiction:** The exclusive place of jurisdiction is Germany, provided the user is a merchant or a legal person under public law. Wafrow UG is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. Berlin will also serve as the place of jurisdiction if the user has no general place of jurisdiction within Germany. Any additional mandatory places of jurisdiction for users classified as consumers, at their respective home or place of residence remain unaffected. Wafrow UG is registered at Pufendorfstr. 4D, 10249 Berlin, Germany
